# XGBoostApplication
This repository is dedicated to some Jupyter Noteooks for XGBoost's Applications on different Datasets.

The repository contains two Notebooks for housing data and kidney disease predicition using XGBoost ( Linear base learners, decision tree base learners, etc) in addition to integrating XGBoost in full pipelines.

The code is realised as part of the datacamp course named Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost.

NB : a ValueError may raise when executing the cross-validation on the kidney disease pipeline, i'm not sure about the cause of the error, any help is more than welcomed.
